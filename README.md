# Predicting-stock-market-experts
Predicted the buy sell patterns of stock market experts using their historical buy sell patterns. Implemented a deep learning based model using Keras in Python.

Part 1: Web Scraping
The data required for the task wasn't freely available, hence it required web scraping. 
As it is easier to work with data in R as compared to python, I used R for this task. 
The library used specifically for scraping part is 'Selenium'

Part 2: Building the Model
For model building part, I used python as it has the latest libraries to work with Machine Learning techniques. 
I went ahead with two techniques, Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks.
Library used was sklearn along with keras (for NN part).
